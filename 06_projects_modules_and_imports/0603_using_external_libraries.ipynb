    "The main pip commands are:\n",

    "Virtual environments are isolated Python environments that allow you to manage each project's dependencies separately. Virtual environments are useful for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Isolation`: Each project can have its own library versions without conflicts with other projects.\n",
    "1. `Order`: Virtual environments help maintain system cleanliness because libraries are not installed globally.\n",
    "1. `Portability`: Using virtual environments makes it easy to transfer a project between different computers, as dependencies are clearly defined."
